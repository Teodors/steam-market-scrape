A tool designed to scrape the Steam Market and analyze item data to reveal profit opportunities when purchasing and reselling.

**Example:**
Lets say there is a `Glock-18` that for the last 5 days has had a highest price of 2 EUR and lowest price of 1 EUR. Now steam markup is 15% of item price. That means there is 0,85 cents to be made. 


## Getting started
It is really straight forward. Just run `npm install` to get dependencies and `node index.js` to start the app on `localhost:80`.

## API
